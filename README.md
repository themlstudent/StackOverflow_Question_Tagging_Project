#### Working Of Stack overflow in Simple Way:

 Anybody can Go an Ask a Question Basically They have to Provide `Title of the Question` , `Description`
 and  `Tags`.
 
Note : Sometimes we have to give `Tags` When we are asking Question on Stack overflow.If we do not give tags it is automatically Generated by the Stack overflow Website with help of their Models.
 
So if we have right `Tags` Given to us or Generate by the Stack oveflow Website we can reach to those People who can answer the question it very fast.

For Example: If You See the first image of Stack overflow website where the question asked by the user `What is the difference between Python's list methods append and extend?` and  the  `tags`  is given by the user  with the help of both of them we have to reach to the person or group of people  who have master in the answering the question  like this.If you see our second image the person `kender` have answerd this type of question on previously  in the same way he will answer this quetion also.So we are are reaching the person or group of people in this way that they answer this type of question very fast.
